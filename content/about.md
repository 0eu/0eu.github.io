Welcome to my digital abode! I'm Evgeny, a Berlin-based software engineer exploring the tech universe. ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

I build the data platform at GetYourGuide. Also, I dive into the captivating realms of distributed systems, database internals, and data engineering.

Join me on my exhilarating journey as I navigate the breathtaking landscapes of Germany through the lens of my camera, conquer hiking trails, and devour cutting-edge tech literature. I'm currently mastering functional programming and dream of developing my database. 

I defy conventional job descriptions and chart my path through the ever-evolving world of technology. So, buckle up and enjoy the ride as we explore the fascinating world of software engineering together!
